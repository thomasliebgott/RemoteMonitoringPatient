# RemoteMonitoringPatient


The product "ViewMed" developed in this project is a system for permanent monitoring of vital parameters and management of patient room occupancy. The system is intended for hospital use and is to be used in intensive care units and hospital wards. Here, the software is designed for trained, medical staff, such as doctors, nurses and other caregivers and is intended to facilitate the monitoring of patients. 

"ViewMed" is designed for monitoring patients whose health condition is unstable and needs to be monitored in order to respond quickly to critical changes in vital signs. The system can be used to monitor groups of patients in different age groups (infants, children and adults up to old age). Parameters such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, body temperature and respiratory rate are displayed.

The system allows up to 16 patients to be displayed on one monitor. In addition, the system has an alarm system that indicates critical changes in vital signs and can be set individually for each patient.
